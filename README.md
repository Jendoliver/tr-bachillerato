# Development of a Videogame (2013-2014)
This repository contains my complete Research Project from my A levels, the Development of a Videogame using Blender, its Game Engine and Python.

The documentation of the project is made in Catalan, but you can still take a look if you want here: https://github.com/Jendoliver/tr-bachillerato/blob/master/TR%20PDF%20i%20metsda/Desenvolupament%20d'un%20videojoc.pdf

If you want to play the game, download 'VIDEOJOC FINAL'. You'll need Blender on your computer to be able to run it, though.
